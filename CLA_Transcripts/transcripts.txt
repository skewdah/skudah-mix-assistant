CLA Mixing Techniques — Excerpts & Rules

1. Parallel compression on kick and snare — blend crushed tone underneath main kit for added weight and attack.
2. Always EQ before compression. Cut mud, then shape dynamics.
3. Boost 8kHz on overheads to bring out cymbal air without harshness.
4. De-ess the reverb send on vocals — not the main vocal — to tame harsh sibilance.
5. Vocal chain: FG-76 (slow grind) → FG-116 (punch) → EQ (cut 300Hz, boost 10kHz) → De-esser → FX sends.
6. Use LCR panning to open the mix. Guitars hard left/right, vocals and bass center.
7. Kick drum EQ: Boost 60Hz, scoop 300Hz, slight boost at 3.5kHz for click.
8. Snare drum: Cut 400Hz boxiness, boost 200Hz body, add snap around 4.5kHz.
9. Print vocal delays/reverbs to audio — allows fader riding and precise muting between phrases.
10. Bass: Low-pass around 4kHz, compress heavily but don’t squash the attack transient. Use SSL comp with slow attack.
11. Vocal reverb: Short plate for intimacy, longer hall for choruses.
12. Group background vocals and apply one consistent stereo reverb and one slap delay.
13. Print samples for drums when needed, but blend subtly so original shells lead the tone.
14. Use saturation for harmonic glue — subtle on guitars, heavier on drum bus.
15. Mix bus chain: VTM → SSL Comp (2:1, slow attack) → EQ lift at 10kHz → FG-X limiter (ceiling -0.1dB, keep dynamics).
16. Toms: Gate hard if bleed is messy, or just high-pass at 80Hz and boost 2.5kHz if clean.
17. CLA loves **tall** mixes — meaning deep low-end, crisp highs, nothing clouding the middle.
18. Clip gain vocal phrases before compression to preserve tone consistency.

Notes:
- Avoid over-EQing at the track level. Do subtle adjustments per track, then glue on busses.
- Think like a console: what would you do with 4 fingers on a real board?

CLA’s Mantras:
- “Mix like it’s going to FM radio.”
- “Control the energy, not just the volume.”
- “If you’re not turning the knobs with purpose, you’re turning them wrong.”
